      <p>
        I'm Solomon and I code.
      </p>
      <p>
        While studying neuroscience, I supported my degree by teaching young
        children how to code with
        <a

          OpenWorld Learning (OWL) </a
        >. OWL brought applied math, programming, and independence to
        disadvantaged children in Denver, Colorado. And for everyone in the
        program, the experience was life-changing.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my students matured and overcame challenges, they inspired me. To
        advance in the program, each child had to integrate their creativity,
        logic, and emotional well-being. In the four years I spent with OWL, I
        bore witness to the joy that programming could bring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, I began to wonder what opportunities awaited me if I switched
        from academia. Of course, there was only one way to find out. Shortly
        before OWL ceased operations, I took a chance on myself and tried a
        different path.
      </p>
      <p>
        This decision led to a 2 year journey of self, group, and mentored
        study; a few portfolio projects; and a new perspective. Today, I write
        clean code, have the mindset to identify and solve problems, and
        continue to learn more about others and their needs.

        When it's time to step away from the computer, you can find me staying
        active, singing choir, recording voiceover tracks, illustrating, and
        writing.
