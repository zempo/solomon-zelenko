      <p>
        To support my psychology degree, I taught young children how to code
        with
        <a

        >
          OpenWorld Learning (OWL) </a
        >. For everyone involved with OWL, it was an incredible experience.
        During OWL's 20 year tenure, disadvantaged children in Denver, Colorado
        were able to discover their independence, have fun, and build skills
        with the Microworlds Curriculumn.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my students overcame challenges, they inspired me. To advance through
        Microworlds, each child had to combine their creativity, logic, and
        emotional well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over many OWL curriculumn meetings, I started to consider becoming a
        programmer too. Shortly before OWL ceased operations, I took a chance on
        myself and tested a different life path.
      </p>
      <p>
        This decision led to a 2 year journey of self-study, mentorship, coding
        meetups, 200 cups of tea, and a new perspective. Today, I write clean
        code, have the mindset of a persistent problem-solver, and continue to
        learn more about people and their needs.
